    Flexbox I THINK is working/being used for the player hand & wrapping it around.
</p>
<p>
    Need to convert the overall player boxes to flexboxes though, so they grow automatically.

Work in progress site is temporarily housed at:
https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/idvgefsg3hgo/b/bucket-20230214-2044/o/GameStart.html
</p>
<p>
It was setup using this tutorial:
https://blog.osdev.org/oci/2020/10/15/oci-objectstorage-website.html
</p>
<p>
Which just uses basic object storage.

Change over to a real VM instance in OCI running a proper HTTP server for when it goes live.

Flash button, stored here in case its needed
< button onclick="(function(){

    temp[0].className = 'borderFlash';

//After the animation runs, the class needs to be changed back.

//TODO for the overall game:
/*

How to track which card is which?  store its Global Number somewhere in the HTML?
Tie each card to an OnClick function, that passes in the card identifier
DONE!!!!

Fix the Flexbox for the player boxes


Change the GlobalID for a card to ALWAYS BE A NUMBER.  No implicit conversions to numbers/strings
EX: let num = Number(cardID);
DONE!!!


The left hand column of the game board is too tall.  Even when the modal DIVs were removed, it was slightly taller than the viewport
Its actually both columns that are too tall
Fixed by adding overflow-y: hidden; to the BODY CSS
DONE!!!


The Discard & Deck cards have too much right spacing on the Prod site.
DONE!!!!
Fixed the discard & draw cards having too much padding in Prod by adding max-width:45% to both


The GameBoard is like 95% responsive right now.  What doesn't work is the buttons across the top (They can slide out of view, with no scrollbar)
And the Discard/Deck section, the Deck card can slide out of view.
Pretty much done.  When I tested on my phone, it was responsive enough to be playable.


Move up the Modal box, so its closer to the top of the page
Also I don't think any modals are that responsive right now.
DONE!!! Moved up.  And when tested on a phone, modals were fine.


Put the name of the next player into the Transition box
DONE!!!


When playing Wild 4, it looks like it hides the current players cards before the color selection popup.
Whereas during Wild 1, player cards are still visible.


When there are 2 players, the cards are too big.  They fill up the box too quickly so that it goes into multiple rows too fast.
Might want to make the boxes smaller or the cards smaller.



ISSUE: When looping over players, player 1 and the computer player have the columns resized to be 50% incorrectly.
Possibly fixed by adjusting the columns min & max widths.  BUT need to test more
And not sure why it resized in the first place.  Should probably check that.
NOPE NOT FIXED COMPLETELY

Issue: If you reach the point where there are no more cards available in the deck, and then play a Draw 2 card, it allows the active player to play the draw 2 then to play another card
Also the continue button doesn't appear.


Things removed that might be added back later:
Challenges to Wild+4
With this card, you must have no other alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card previously played.
If you play this card illegally, you may be challenged by the other player to show your hand to him/her. If guilty, you need to draw 4 cards.
If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.
Calling UNO at the end of the game
The first discard card being a non-number card.
Removing the ability to play a different card after drawing a new card (Only the newly drawn card can be played) .



Note: Functionality that would be good to add:
Table status SAVE, where all player data is written to a cookie
const today = new Date();
document.cookie = "UNOGameState=None;expires=" + today.setTime(today.getTime() + (365*24*60*60*1000)); + "; path=/";
Just dump everything into JSON, then convert that to base64 to store in the cookie
Advanced Computer Player, where it makes intelligent moves not just whatever move next is valid.
